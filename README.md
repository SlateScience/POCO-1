POCO block for Cinder 0.8.5 & C++11
===================================

Provides support for POCO 1.4.6p1 on OSX, iOS and Android (**Windows support** should be trivial to add, contributions are welcome...)  

Check the [building instructions](../../wiki/Building-instructions). **UPDATE:** The OSX libs had to be rebuilt for POCO to work properly with XCode 6.1.1.  

*TODO:* Everything should be rebuilt as well for 64-bit support (OSX and iOS), including the external *crypto* and *SSL* components.
