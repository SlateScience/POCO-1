POCO block for Cinder 0.8.5 & C++11
===================================

Provides support for POCO 1.4.6p1 on OSX, iOS and Android (**Windows support** should be trivial to add, contributions are welcome...)  

Check the [building instructions](../../wiki/Building-instructions) (*UPDATE:* 64-bit support for OSX and iOS has just been implemented.)  

*TODO:* Test further and provide solution for the external *crypto* and *SSL* components.
